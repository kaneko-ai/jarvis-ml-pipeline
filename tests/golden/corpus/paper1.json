    "abstract": "We demonstrate that PD-1 blockade significantly enhances T-cell activation. The results show that pembrolizumab (n=100) improved overall survival (p<0.001) compared to placebo. In vitro experiments confirmed the mechanism via Western blot analysis. However, small sample size is a limitation of this study.",
