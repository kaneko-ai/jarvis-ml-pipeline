In this\nstudy, we employed CD73 gene-targeted mice to investigate the role of host-derived CD73 on antitumor\nimmunity and tumor cell metastasis. We found that CD73 ablation significantly suppressed the growth ofovalbumin-expressing MC38 colon cancer, EG7 lymphoma, AT-3 mammary tumors, and B16F10 melanoma. Theprotective effect of CD73 deficiency on primary tumors was dependent on CD8\nþT cells and associated with an\nincreased frequency of antigen-specific CD8þT cells in peripheral blood and tumors and increased antigen-\nspecific IFN- gproduction. Replicate studies in bone marrow chimeras established that both hematopoietic and\nnonhematopoietic expression of CD73 was important to promote tumor immune escape.

The purpose of this study was to identify genetic \nvariants of genes related to estrogen signaling in a large city hospital-based cohort and to determine their interactions \nwith lifestyles. Methods:  This is a case-control study. Three hundred ninety participants diagnosed with breast cancer \nwere compared with 36,290 controls(no cancer)to explore the genetic variants to influence breast cancer risk.

Nevertheless, there remains controversy in clini -\ncal practice about using EGFR-TKI adjuvant therapy for \npatients with stage IB EGFRm NSCLC, as many with \nstage IB disease can achieve excellent prognosis with \nsurgery alone [7].

The potential for overtreatment with \nadjuvant targeted therapy in stage IB EGFRm NSCLC \ncases has garnered increasing clinical attention.

It merits emphasis that \nthese high-risk factors currently in use originated from \nthe conventional chemotherapy era, aimed at identifying \npatients at increased risk of postoperative recurrence in \nstage IB NSCLC.
