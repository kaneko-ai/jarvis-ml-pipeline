The immune checkpoint \npathways have considerable activity within cancer cells, hence enabling the evasion of \nimmunological responses by malignant tumors [ 2].

The process operates through the \ncatalysis of ATP phosphohydrolysis, leading to the synthesis of adenosine monophos -\nphate [ 12, 13]. The protein CD39 is composed of a total of 510 amino acids, which \nincludes seven notable N-glycosylation sites, 11 cysteine residues, and sites that are situ -\nated within the inner membrane [ 14–16]. CD39 is comprised of five conserved regions \ncalled apyrase domains, which are essential for the formation of the active site and the \ncatalytic process involved in the phosphohydrolysis of extracellular nucleotides [ 17–\n19]. CD39 is predominantly expressed by several cell types, including endothelial cells, \nimmunological cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs), Langerhans cells, neutrophils, B cells, \nmonoc"}

The expression of CD39 is modulated by multiple variables, such \nas proinflammatory cytokines, hypoxia, oxidative stress, specificity protein 1 (Sp1), and \nsignal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) [ 23, 24]. The enzyme CD73, \nwhich is anchored to glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), plays a pivotal role in facili -\ntating the conversion of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine and inorganic \nphosphate [ 25]. After the elimination of the GPI anchor, the soluble form of CD73 has a \nfunction comparable to that of its membrane-bound form [ 26]. CD73 consists of three \ndiscrete domains: an N-terminal domain containing metal-binding sites, a C-terminus \ndomain housing the catalytic site, and a short alpha helix connecting the N and C-ter -\nminal domains [ 27, 28].

Moreover, it is plausible to consider the utili -\nzation of therapeutic approaches to specifically address the succeeding series of occur -\nrences specifically by modulating the functioning of adenosine deaminase. This can be \naccomplished by manipulating adenosine metabolism, which is mediated by CD39 and \nCD73. To assess the potential therapeutic advantages of targeting the adenosinergic axis \nfacilitated by CD39 and CD73 in patients with aggressive malignancies, it is impera -\ntive to carry out continuous clinical trials that encompass a comprehensive examina -\ntion of CD39 and CD73 expression, their respective functionalities, and the subsequent \ncascade of events occurring within the tumor microenvironment. Currently, ongoing \nclinical trials are being conducted to assess the effectiveness of anti-CD39 and anti-\nCD73 treatment. Future research should focus on detailed mechanistic studies and bio -\nmarker-driven patient stratification to elucidate synergistic interactions in combination \ntherapies.\nAcknowledgements\nNone applicable.\nAuthor contributions\nXinyu Yin and Ying Yang: Writing - original draft, Data curation.

Rando\nRhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common type of soft tissue sarcoma in children \nand adolescents. Fusion- negative RMS (FN- RMS) accounts for more than 80% of all \nRMS cases. The long - term event - free survival rate for patients with high - grade FN - RMS \nis below 30%, highlighting the need for improved therapeutic strategies. CD73 is a 5′ \nectonucleotidase that hydrolyzes AMP to adenosine and regulates the purinergic sign-\naling pathway. We found that CD73 is elevated in FN- RMS tumors that express high \nlevels of TWIST2. While high expression of CD73 contributes to the pathogenesis of \nmultiple cancers, its role in FN- RMS has not been investigated. We found that CD73 \nknockdown decreased FN- RMS cell growth while up- regulating the myogenic differ-\nentiation program.

Moreover, mutation of the catalytic residues of CD73 rendered the \nprotein enzymatically inactive and abolished its ability to stimulate FN- RMS growth. \nOverexpression of wildtype CD73, but not the catalytically inactive mutant, in CD73 \nknockdown FN- RMS cells restored their growth capacity.

However, RMS cells are blocked early in the muscle differ­\nentiation pathway and lack expression of terminal myogenic markers even amid high levels \nof skeletal muscle master regulators such as MyoD (1). RMS is classified into two main \ntypes based on their molecular characteristics: fusion- positive RMS (FP- RMS) and \nfusion- negative RMS (FN- RMS). FP- RMS harbors chromosomal translocations t(2;13) \nand t(1;13) that result in the generation of PAX3- FOXO1 or PAX7- FOXO1 fusion \noncoproteins (2). In contrast, FN- RMS, which accounts for more than 80% of all RMS \ncases, does not carry these chromosomal translocations, and recurrent driver mutations \nwere found to be uncommon (3). Around 15% of all RMS patients present with metastases \nwhen diagnosed, and the long- term event- free survival rate for these cases is below 30% \n(2, 4).

Importantly, this nucleoside has emerged as a key\nsignaling molecule serving to attenuate excessive immune responses\nduring infection and other in ﬂammatory insults (1, 2). The role of\nadenosine as a potent immune suppressant within the tumor micro-\nenvironment (TME) is now appreciated as a prominent mechanism of\nimmune escape and tumor progression (2 –5). CD73, also known as\necto-50-nucleotidase, converts extracellular AMP into adenosine and\norganic phosphate and is the major enzyme involved in the generation\nof adenosine (6). In the absence of disease, CD73 is expressed on\nlymphocytes and endothelial cells and plays a role in the regulation of\nendothelial barrier function (7, 8) and cell migration (9, 10). In\nmalignancy, CD73 is overexpressed and has been correlated withpoor prognosis (11, 12). While there is a clear role for CD73-expressing\ncancer cells in promoting tumor gr"}

In\nmalignancy, CD73 is overexpressed and has been correlated withpoor prognosis (11, 12). While there is a clear role for CD73-expressing\ncancer cells in promoting tumor growth (13, 14), expression is not\nrestricted to just cancer cells. CD73 is also found on tumor-in ﬁltrating\nmyeloid cells (15, 16), cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts (17), and on T cells,\nwhere CD73 enzymatic activity results in local accumulation of\nadenosine and activation of the adenosine receptor A 2AR. The resul-\ntant dampening of T cell –mediated antitumor immunity is thus\nmediated through CD73-derived adenosine and subsequent A 2AR\nsignaling in T cells (5, 14, 18 –20). Indeed, in vivo reconstitution\nstudies with CD73-de ﬁcient regulatory T cells (T reg)i nm i c e\ndemonstrate a critical role for T cell –derived adenosine in creating\nan immunosuppressiv e environment and promoting tumor growth\n(18, 21, 22). CD39, an enzyme that converts extracellular ATP to\nAMP, is also expressed on many cell types within the TME and\ncooperates with CD73 to convert e xtracellular ATP to adenosine.\nFor example, activated T regsexpress both CD39 and CD73 (21 –23)\nand have been shown to cooperate with CD73"}

Correspondingly, CD73 and adenosine receptor inhibition is\nbeing investigated in solid tumor indications in regimens with PD-1\nblockade (26, 34). AB680 (quemliclustat) is a potent, reversible, small-\nmolecule competitive inhibitor of human CD73. It exhibits a Kiof 5\npmol/L (35) and is characterized by low plasma clearance and a long\nhalf-life in preclinical species, resulting in a pharmacokinetic pro ﬁle\nsuitable for long-acting parenteral administration (36). In humans,\ninitial data show that AB680 is well tolerated and exhibits a pharma-\ncokinetic pro ﬁle (long half-life) suitable for intravenous administra-\ntion (36, 37). AB680 is currently being evaluated in patients with\ntreatment-na €/C16ve pancreatic cancer (ref. 37; NCT04104672), metastatic\ncolorectal cancer (NCT04660812), and castrate- and androgen-\nresistant prostate cancer (NCT04381832).

In this setting, it is dif ﬁcult to distinguish the\ncancer cell –intrinsic versus cancer cell –extrinsic effect of CD73\ninhibition. Like others that have established the role of CD73 in\nimmunosuppression (2 7, 28, 32), we took the opportunity to ex-\nploit the fact that many commonly used murine cancer cell lines,\nexempli ﬁed by B16F10 (29, 45), exhibit low or no CD73. While the\ncancer cells lack CD73, surrounding vasculature and T cells express\nCD73 and are capable of synthesiz ing adenosine. Thus, we were able\nto isolate ef ﬁcacy observed with AB680 to soluble, immune, and/or\nstromal CD73 enzymatic activity.

These resident macrophages are called large 47 \nperitoneal macrophages ( 8), and they coexist with small peritoneal macrophages (9) that arise from monocytes 48 \n(10). Because the pleural and pericardial serosal cavities have similarly distinct tissue resident macrophages  as 49 \nthe peritoneal cavity  (11-13), more universal term s for these macrophages in the three serosal tissue 50 \ncompartments  are ‘large cavity macrophages’ (LCM s) and ‘small cavity macrophages’ (SCM s).

These Gata6- deficient 56 \nmacrophages  retain certain  unique features of LCMs, including surface expression of ICAM2 (15, 16) , and while 57 \nthey no longer express CD73 and CD62P,  they co-express  LYVE1 and CD206 (16, 18) . Explanations for the 58 \nreduced numbers of LCMs in the absence of Gata6 include a higher propensity for cell death ( 16), impaired 59 \nproliferation ( 17), and entrapment  of differentiation intermediates  in the nearby omentum (15), a mesothelial cell- 60 \nlined specialized peritoneal fold containing adipose tissue rich in l"}

Indeed, t he identification of large numbers of apparent ICAM2+ LCM  differentiation 62 \nintermediates that were not yet Gata6+ in the omentum prompted  Okabe and Medzhitov  to suggest that  the 63 \nomentum provides essential signals, including the production of retinoic acid, that support the induction of Gata6 64 \nand final maturation of LCMs  (15). This interesting concept positioned the omentum as  a site not just for 65 \nmacrophage clearance during the resolution of inflammation ( 1, 19 ) but also for their developmental origin. 66 \nUndefined omental factor (s) and retinoic acid were proposed as niche factors that supported LCM development 67 \nand maintenance ( 15).
