Programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, deliver inhibitory signals that regulate the balance between T cell activation, tolerance, and immunopathology. Immune responses to foreign and self-antigens require specific and balanced responses to clear pathogens and tumors and yet maintain tolerance. Induction and maintenance of T cell tolerance requires PD-1, and its ligand PD-L1 on nonhematopoietic cells can limit effector T cell responses and protect tissues from immune-mediated tissue damage. The PD-1:PD-L pathway also has been usurped by microorganisms and tumors to attenuate antimicrobial or tumor immunity and facilitate chronic infection and tumor survival. The identification of B7-1 as an additional binding partner for PD-L1, together with the discovery of an inhibitory bidirectional interaction between PD-L1 and B7-1, reveals new ways the B7:CD28 family regulates T cell activation and tolerance. In this review, we discuss current understanding of the immunoregulatory functions of PD-1 and its ligands and their therapeutic potential.

Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is a cell surface receptor that functions as a T cell checkpoint and plays a central role in regulating T cell exhaustion. Binding of PD-1 to its ligand, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), activates downstream signaling pathways and inhibits T cell activation. Moreover abnormally high PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and antigen-presenting cells in the tumor microenvironment mediates tumor immune escape, and the development of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies has recently become a hot topic in cancer immunotherapy. Here, we review the structure of PD-1 and PD-L1, the function of the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway, the application of PD-1 or PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies and future directions for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies with combination therapies. Cancer immunotherapy using PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade may require more studies, and this approach may be curative for patients with many types of cancer in the future.

<summary>Abstract (English)</summary>

The PD-1/PD-L1 coinhibitory pathway has critical roles in the immune response and autoimmunity via the regulation of T cell activity. Excessive activity and high expression of this pathway suppresses the function of T cells and immunity. Recent research has indicated that tumour cells express high levels of PD-L1, which has an immunosuppressive effect and can result in treatment failure. Anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1 agents have well-established beneficial effects on mortality and quality of life in cancer patients. Based on the regulatory effects and therapeutic value of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in malignant disorders, we propose that it also regulates cell immunity and in CHD and atherosclerosis. Low expression level of PD-1/ PD-L1 or anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy accelerates the immune processes in CHD and aggravates disease according to numerous studies. A few studies have provided strong evidence that changes in the expression levels of PD-1 or PD-L1 can alter the degree of inflammation and the state of coronary plaques in atherosclerosis. In this review, we summarise the alterations of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway and discuss its role in CHD.
