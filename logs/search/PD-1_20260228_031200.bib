  abstract = {Programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, deliver inhibitory signals that regulate the balance between T cell activation, tolerance, and immunopathology. Immune responses to foreign and self-antigens require specific and balanced responses to clear pathogens and tumors and yet maintain tolerance. Induction and maintenance of T cell tolerance requires PD-1, and its ligand PD-L1 on nonhematopoietic cells can limit effector T cell responses and protect tissues from immune-mediated...},

  abstract = {Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is a cell surface receptor that functions as a T cell checkpoint and plays a central role in regulating T cell exhaustion. Binding of PD-1 to its ligand, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), activates downstream signaling pathways and inhibits T cell activation. Moreover abnormally high PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and antigen-presenting cells in the tumor microenvironment mediates tumor immune escape, and the development of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies has recently beco...},

  abstract = {The PD-1/PD-L1 coinhibitory pathway has critical roles in the immune response and autoimmunity via the regulation of T cell activity. Excessive activity and high expression of this pathway suppresses the function of T cells and immunity. Recent research has indicated that tumour cells express high levels of PD-L1, which has an immunosuppressive effect and can result in treatment failure. Anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1 agents have well-established beneficial effects on mortality and quality of life in c...},
