    "abstract": "Aging involves the systemic deterioration of all known cell types in most eukaryotes. Several recently discovered compounds that extend the healthspan and lifespan of model organisms decelerate pathways that govern the aging process. Among these geroprotectors, spermidine, a natural polyamine ubiquitously found in organisms from all kingdoms, prolongs the lifespan of fungi, nematodes, insects and rodents. In mice, it also postpones the manifestation of various age-associated disorders such as cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration. The specific features of spermidine, including its presence in common food items, make it an interesting candidate for translational aging research. Here, we review novel insights into the geroprotective mode of action of spermidine at the molecular level, as we discuss strategies for elucidating its clinical potential.",

    "abstract": "Caloric restriction and intermittent fasting prolong the lifespan and healthspan of model organisms and improve human health. The natural polyamine spermidine has been similarly linked to autophagy enhancement, geroprotection and reduced incidence of cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases across species borders. Here, we asked whether the cellular and physiological consequences of caloric restriction and fasting depend on polyamine metabolism. We report that spermidine levels increased upon distinct regimens of fasting or caloric restriction in yeast, flies, mice and human volunteers. Genetic or pharmacological blockade of endogenous spermidine synthesis reduced fasting-induced autophagy in yeast, nematodes and human cells. Furthermore, perturbing the polyamine pathway in vivo abrogated the lifespan- and healthspan-extending effects, as well as the cardioprotective and anti-arthritic consequences of fasting. Mechanistically, spermidine mediated these effects via autophagy induction and hypusination of the translation regulator eIF5A. In summary, the polyamine-hypusination axis emerges as a phylogenetically conserved metabolic control hub for fasting-mediated autophagy enhancement and longevity.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is an abnormal protein degradation and recycling process that is impaired in various neurological diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease. Spermidine is a natural polyamine found in various plant- and meat-based diets that can induce autophagy, and is decreased in various neurodegenerative diseases. It acts on epigenetic enzymes like E1A-binding protein p300, HAT enzymes like Iki3p and Sas3p, and α-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 that modulate autophagy. Histone modifications like acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation could influence autophagy. Autophagy is epigenetically regulated in various neurodegenerative disorders with many epigenetic enzymes and miRNAs. Polyamine regulation plays an essential role in the disease pathogenesis of AD and PD. Therefore, in this review, we discuss various enzymes and miRNAs involved in the epigenetic regulation of autophagy in neurodegenerative disorders and the role of spermidine as an autophagy enhancer. The alterations in spermidine-mediated regulation of Beclin-1, LC3-II, and p62 genes in AD and other PD-associated enzymes could impact the process of autophagy in these neurodegenerative diseases. With the ever-growing data and such promising effects of spermidine in autophagy, we feel it could be a promising target in this area and worth further detailed studies.",

    "abstract": "Interventions that delay aging and protect from age-associated disease are slowly approaching clinical implementation. Such interventions include caloric restriction mimetics, which are defined as agents that mimic the beneficial effects of dietary restriction while limiting its detrimental effects. One such agent, the natural polyamine spermidine, has prominent cardioprotective and neuroprotective effects and stimulates anticancer immunosurveillance in rodent models. Moreover, dietary polyamine uptake correlates with reduced cardiovascular and cancer-related mortality in human epidemiological studies. Spermidine preserves mitochondrial function, exhibits anti-inflammatory properties, and prevents stem cell senescence. Mechanistically, it shares the molecular pathways engaged by other caloric restriction mimetics: It induces protein deacetylation and depends on functional autophagy. Because spermidine is already present in daily human nutrition, clinical trials aiming at increasing the uptake of this polyamine appear feasible.",

    "abstract": "Spermidine is a naturally occurring endogenous polyamine synthesized from diamine putrescine. It is a well-known autophagy inducer that maintains cellular and neuronal homeostasis. Healthy brain development and function are dependent on brain polyamine concentration. Polyamines interact with the opioid system, glutamatergic signaling and neuroinflammation in the neuronal and glial compartments. Among the polyamines, spermidine is found highest in the human brain. Age-linked fluctuations in the spermidine levels may possibly contribute to the impairments in neural network and neurogenesis. Exogenously administered spermidine helps in the treatment of brain diseases. Further, current studies highlight the ability of spermidine to promote longevity by inducing autophagy. Still, the causal neuroprotective mechanism of spermidine in neuronal dysfunction remains unidentified. This review aims to summarize various neuroprotective effects of spermidine related to anti-aging/ anti-inflammatory properties and the prevention of neurotoxicity that helps in achieving beneficial effects in age-related neurological disorder. We also expose the signaling cascades modulated by spermidine which might result in therapeutic action. The present review highlights clinical studies along with in-vivo and in-vitro preclinical studies to provide a new dimension for the therapeutic potential of spermidine in neurological disorders.",

An aging model, the senescence accelerated mouse-8 (SAMP8), was used in this study. Novel object recognition and the open field test results showed that oral administration of spermidine, spermine and rapamycin increased discrimination index, modified number, inner squares distance and times. Spermidine and spermine increased the activity of SOD, and decreased the level of MDA in the aging brain. Spermidine and spermine phosphorylate AMPK and regulate autophagy proteins (LC3, Beclin 1 and p62). Spermidine and spermine balanced mitochondrial and maintain energy for neuron, with the regulation of MFN1, MFN2, DRP1, COX IV and ATP. In addition, western blot results (Bcl-2, Bax and Caspase-3, NLRP3, IL-18, IL-1β) showed that spermidine and spermine prevented apoptosis and inflammation, and elevate the expression of neurotrophic factors, including NGF, PSD95and PSD93 and BDNF in neurons of SAMP8 mice. These results indicated that the effect of spermidine and spermine on anti-aging is related with improving autophagy and mitochondrial function.",

We previously reported that spermidine levels were significantly reduced in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) of the lung. The present study assessed the potential beneficial effects of spermidine on lung fibrosis and investigated the possible mechanism. Lung fibrosis was established in mice using bleomycin (BLM), and exogenous spermidine was administered daily by intraperitoneal injection (50 mg/kg in phosphate-buffered saline). BLM-induced alveolar epithelial cells showed significant increases in apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-related mediators, and spermidine attenuated BLM-induced apoptosis and activation of the ERS-related pathway. Senescence-associated β-gal staining and decreased expression of p16 and p21 showed that spermidine ameliorated BLM-induced premature cellular senescence. In addition, spermidine enhanced beclin-1-dependent autophagy and autophagy modulators in IPF fibroblasts and BLM-induced mouse lungs, in which inflammation and collagen deposition were significantly decreased. This beneficial effect was related to the antiapoptotic downregulation of the ERS pathway, antisenescence effects, and autophagy activation. Our findings suggest that spermidine could be a therapeutic agent for IPF treatment.",

Here, we report that administration of spermidine, a natural polyamine whose intracellular concentration declines during human ageing, markedly extended the lifespan of yeast, flies and worms, and human immune cells. In addition, spermidine administration potently inhibited oxidative stress in ageing mice. In ageing yeast, spermidine treatment triggered epigenetic deacetylation of histone H3 through inhibition of histone acetyltransferases (HAT), suppressing oxidative stress and necrosis. Conversely, depletion of endogenous polyamines led to hyperacetylation, generation of reactive oxygen species, early necrotic death and decreased lifespan. The altered acetylation status of the chromatin led to significant upregulation of various autophagy-related transcripts, triggering autophagy in yeast, flies, worms and human cells. Finally, we found that enhanced autophagy is crucial for polyamine-induced suppression of necrosis and enhanced longevity.",

This fasting-induced surge in spermidine constitutes the critical first step of a phylogenetically conserved biochemical cascade that leads to spermidine-dependent hypusination of EIF5A (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A), which favors the translation of the pro-macroautophagic/autophagic TFEB (transcription factor EB), and hence an increase in autophagic flux. We observed that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the spermidine increase by inhibition of ODC1 (ornithine decarboxylase 1) prevents the pro-autophagic and antiaging effects of fasting in yeast, nematodes, flies and mice. Moreover, knockout or knockdown of the enzymes required for EIF5A hypusination abolish fasting-mediated autophagy enhancement and longevity extension in these organisms. Of note, autophagy and longevity induced by rapamycin obey the same rule, meaning that they are tied to an increase in spermidine synthesis. These findings indicate that spermidine is not only a \"caloric restriction mimetic\" in the sense that its supplementation mimics the beneficial effects of nutrient deprivation on organismal health but that it is also an obligatory downstream effector of the antiaging effects of fasting and rapamycin.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is associated with impaired intestinal barrier function and dysbiosis of the gut microbiota. Spermidine, a polyamine that acts as an autophagy inducer, has important benefits in patients with aging-associated diseases and metabolic dysfunction. However, the mechanism of spermidine on obesity remains unclear. Here, we show that spermidine intake is negatively correlated with obesity in both humans and mice. Spermidine supplementation causes a significant loss of weight and improves insulin resistance in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. These effects are associated with the alleviation of metabolic endotoxemia and enhancement of intestinal barrier function, which might be mediated through autophagy pathway and TLR4-mediated microbial signaling transduction. Moreover, spermidine causes the significant alteration of microbiota composition and function. Microbiota depletion compromises function, while transplantation of spermidine-altered microbiota confers protection against obesity. These changes might partly be driven by an SCFA-producing bacterium, ",

    "abstract": "Advanced age is a primary risk factor for female infertility due to reduced ovarian reserve and declining oocyte quality. However, as an important contributing factor, the role of metabolic regulation during reproductive aging is poorly understood. Here, we applied untargeted metabolomics to identify spermidine as a critical metabolite in ovaries to protect oocytes against aging. In particular, we found that the spermidine level was reduced in ovaries of aged mice and that supplementation with spermidine promoted follicle development, oocyte maturation, early embryonic development and female fertility of aged mice. By microtranscriptomic analysis, we further discovered that spermidine-induced recovery of oocyte quality was mediated by enhancement of mitophagy activity and mitochondrial function in aged mice, and this mechanism of action was conserved in porcine oocytes under oxidative stress. Altogether, our findings suggest that spermidine supplementation could represent a therapeutic strategy to ameliorate oocyte quality and reproductive outcome in cis-gender women and other persons trying to conceive at an advanced age. Future work is needed to test whether this approach can be safely and effectively translated to humans.",

    "abstract": "Decreased cognitive performance is a hallmark of brain aging, but the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic avenues remain poorly understood. Recent studies have revealed health-protective and lifespan-extending effects of dietary spermidine, a natural autophagy-promoting polyamine. Here, we show that dietary spermidine passes the blood-brain barrier in mice and increases hippocampal eIF5A hypusination and mitochondrial function. Spermidine feeding in aged mice affects behavior in homecage environment tasks, improves spatial learning, and increases hippocampal respiratory competence. In a Drosophila aging model, spermidine boosts mitochondrial respiratory capacity, an effect that requires the autophagy regulator Atg7 and the mitophagy mediators Parkin and Pink1. Neuron-specific Pink1 knockdown abolishes spermidine-induced improvement of olfactory associative learning. This suggests that the maintenance of mitochondrial and autophagic function is essential for enhanced cognition by spermidine feeding. Finally, we show large-scale prospective data linking higher dietary spermidine intake with a reduced risk for cognitive impairment in humans.",

    "abstract": "Aging is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and death. Here we show that oral supplementation of the natural polyamine spermidine extends the lifespan of mice and exerts cardioprotective effects, reducing cardiac hypertrophy and preserving diastolic function in old mice. Spermidine feeding enhanced cardiac autophagy, mitophagy and mitochondrial respiration, and it also improved the mechano-elastical properties of cardiomyocytes in vivo, coinciding with increased titin phosphorylation and suppressed subclinical inflammation. Spermidine feeding failed to provide cardioprotection in mice that lack the autophagy-related protein Atg5 in cardiomyocytes. In Dahl salt-sensitive rats that were fed a high-salt diet, a model for hypertension-induced congestive heart failure, spermidine feeding reduced systemic blood pressure, increased titin phosphorylation and prevented cardiac hypertrophy and a decline in diastolic function, thus delaying the progression to heart failure. In humans, high levels of dietary spermidine, as assessed from food questionnaires, correlated with reduced blood pressure and a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease. Our results suggest a new and feasible strategy for protection against cardiovascular disease.",

The polyamine pathway is highly conserved from bacteria to mammals and spermidine (prominently found in some kinds of aged cheese, wheat germs, nuts, soybeans, and fermented products thereof, among others) is an intrinsic part of the human diet. Apart from nutrition, spermidine is available to mammalian organisms from intracellular biosynthesis and microbial production in the gut. Importantly, externally supplied spermidine (via drinking water or food) prolongs lifespan, activates autophagy, improves mitochondrial function, and refills polyamine pools that decline during aging in various tissues of model organisms, including mice.

    "abstract": "Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), also known as spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that causes loss of balance and motor co-ordination, eventually leading to paralysis. It is caused by the autosomal dominant inheritance of a long CAG trinucleotide repeat sequence within the ATXN3 gene, encoding for an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat sequence within the ataxin-3 protein. Ataxin-3 containing an expanded polyQ repeat is known to be highly prone to intraneuronal aggregation, and previous studies have demonstrated that protein quality control pathways, such as autophagy, are impaired in MJD patients and animal models of the disease. In this study, we tested the therapeutic potential of spermidine on zebrafish and rodent models of MJD to determine its capacity to induce autophagy and improve functional output. Spermidine treatment of transgenic MJD zebrafish induced autophagy and resulted in increased distances swum by the MJD zebrafish. Interestingly, treatment of the CMVMJD135 mouse model of MJD with spermidine added to drinking water did not produce any improvement in motor behaviour assays, neurological testing or neuropathology. In fact, wild type mice treated with spermidine were found to have decreased rotarod performance when compared to control animals. Immunoblot analysis of protein lysates extracted from mouse cerebellar tissue found little differences between the groups, except for an increased level of phospho-ULK1 in spermidine treated animals, suggesting that autophagy was indeed induced. As we detected decreased motor performance in wild type mice following treatment with spermidine, we conducted follow up studies into the effects of spermidine treatment in zebrafish. Interestingly, we found that in addition to inducing autophagy, spermidine treatment also induced apoptosis, particularly in wild type zebrafish. These findings suggest that spermidine treatment may not be therapeutically beneficial for the treatment of MJD, and in fact warrants caution due to the potential negative side effects caused by induction of apoptosis.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau along with glial cell-mediated neuroinflammation are prominent pathogenic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In recent years, impairment of autophagy has been identified as another important feature contributing to AD progression. Therefore, the potential of the autophagy activator spermidine, a small body-endogenous polyamine often used as dietary supplement, was assessed on Aβ pathology and glial cell-mediated neuroinflammation. RESULTS: Oral treatment of the amyloid prone AD-like APPPS1 mice with spermidine reduced neurotoxic soluble Aβ and decreased AD-associated neuroinflammation. Mechanistically, single nuclei sequencing revealed AD-associated microglia to be the main target of spermidine. This microglia population was characterized by increased AXL levels and expression of genes implicated in cell migration and phagocytosis. A subsequent proteome analysis of isolated microglia confirmed the anti-inflammatory and cytoskeletal effects of spermidine in APPPS1 mice. In primary microglia and astrocytes, spermidine-induced autophagy subsequently affected TLR3- and TLR4-mediated inflammatory processes, phagocytosis of Aβ and motility. Interestingly, spermidine regulated the neuroinflammatory response of microglia beyond transcriptional control by interfering with the assembly of the inflammasome. CONCLUSIONS: Our data highlight that the autophagy activator spermidine holds the potential to enhance Aβ degradation and to counteract glia-mediated neuroinflammation in AD pathology.",

    "abstract": "Failure to make adaptive immune responses is a hallmark of aging. Reduced B cell function leads to poor vaccination efficacy and a high prevalence of infections in the elderly. Here we show that reduced autophagy is a central molecular mechanism underlying immune senescence. Autophagy levels are specifically reduced in mature lymphocytes, leading to compromised memory B cell responses in old individuals. Spermidine, an endogenous polyamine metabolite, induces autophagy in vivo and rejuvenates memory B cell responses. Mechanistically, spermidine post-translationally modifies the translation factor eIF5A, which is essential for the synthesis of the autophagy transcription factor TFEB. Spermidine is depleted in the elderly, leading to reduced TFEB expression and autophagy. Spermidine supplementation restored this pathway and improved the responses of old human B cells. Taken together, our results reveal an unexpected autophagy regulatory mechanism mediated by eIF5A at the translational level, which can be harnessed to reverse immune senescence in humans.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy, a process catabolizing intracellular components to maintain energy homeostasis, impacts aging and metabolism. Spermidine, a natural polyamine and autophagy activator, extends life span across a variety of species, including mice. In addition to protecting cardiac and liver tissue, spermidine also affects adipose tissue through unexplored mechanisms. Here, we examined spermidine in the links between autophagy and systemic metabolism. Consistently, daily injection of spermidine delivered even at late life is sufficient to cause a trend in life-span extension in wild-type mice. We further found that spermidine has minimal metabolic effects in young and old mice under normal nutrition. However, spermidine counteracts high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity by increasing lipolysis in visceral fat. Mechanistically, spermidine increases the hepatokine fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) expression in liver without reducing food intake. Spermidine also modulates FGF21 in adipose tissues, elevating FGF21 expression in subcutaneous fat, but reducing it in visceral fat. Despite this, FGF21 is not required for spermidine action, since Fgf21-/- mice were still protected from HFD. Furthermore, the enhanced lipolysis by spermidine was also independent of autophagy in adipose tissue, given that adipose-specific autophagy-deficient (Beclin-1flox/+Fabp4-cre) mice remained spermidine-responsive under HFD. Our results suggest that the metabolic effects of spermidine occur through systemic changes in metabolism, involving multiple mechanistic pathways.",

    "abstract": "The restriction of calories, branched-chain amino acids, and methionine have all been shown to extend lifespan in model organisms. Recently, glycine was found to boost longevity in genetically heterogenous mice. This simple amino acid similarly extends lifespan in rats and improves health in mammalian models of age-related disease. While compelling data indicate that glycine is a pro-longevity molecule, divergent mechanisms may underlie its effects on aging. Glycine is abundant in collagen, a building block for glutathione, a precursor to creatine, and an acceptor for the enzyme glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT). A review of the literature strongly implicates GNMT, which clears methionine from the body by taking a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine and methylating glycine to form sarcosine. In flies, Gnmt is required for reduced insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling and dietary restriction to fully extend lifespan. The geroprotector spermidine requires Gnmt to upregulate autophagy genes and boost longevity. Moreover, the overexpression of Gnmt is sufficient to extend lifespan and reduce methionine levels. Sarcosine, or methylglycine, declines with age in multiple species and is capable of inducing autophagy both in vitro and in vivo. Taken all together, existing evidence suggests that glycine prolongs life by mimicking methionine restriction and activating autophagy.",

    "abstract": "Genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors primarily determine the lifespan of humans. From these, nutrition is a key component affecting our health, and several studies particularly in model organisms and rodents have shown that nutrition has also the potential to increase lifespan. This review, therefore, aimed to summarize and discuss the most important nutritional components and diets which have been repeatedly associated with longevity. A brief summary of mechanistic factors involved, like for example mTor, IGF-1, and autophagy, will also be presented. Finally, the association of foods and diets with all-cause mortality will be summarized by conducting a mini umbrella review of available meta-analyses. The main conclusions of this review are that caloric restriction without malnutrition, methionine restriction, lower protein intake or supplementation of spermidine are major life-extending factors, in model organisms or rodents. In humans, certain healthy foods are associated with longer telomere length, and reductions in protein intake with lower IGF-1 levels, respectively, both relations being associated with longer lifespan. Furthermore, a high intake of whole grains, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and also coffee is associated with a reduced risk for all-cause mortality whereas a high intake of (red) meat and especially processed meat is positively related to all-cause mortality. In addition, the Mediterranean and also high-quality diets are associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk.",

Indeed, aging promotes the structural and functional declines of both the heart and the blood circulation system. In this review, we revise the contribution of known longevity pathways to cardiovascular health and delineate the possibilities to interfere with them. In particular, we evaluate autophagy, the intracellular catabolic recycling system associated with life- and health-span extension. We present genetic models, pharmacological interventions, and dietary strategies that block, reduce, or enhance autophagy upon age-related cardiovascular deterioration. Caloric restriction or caloric restriction mimetics like metformin, spermidine, and rapamycin (all of which trigger autophagy) are among the most promising cardioprotective interventions during aging. We conclude that autophagy is a fundamental process to ensure cardiac and vascular health during aging and outline its putative therapeutic importance.",

    "abstract": "Ageing of the cardiovascular system is associated with frailty and various life-threatening diseases. As global populations grow older, age-related conditions increasingly determine healthspan and lifespan. The circulatory system not only supplies nutrients and oxygen to all tissues of the human body and removes by-products but also builds the largest interorgan communication network, thereby serving as a gatekeeper for healthy ageing. Therefore, elucidating organ-specific and cell-specific ageing mechanisms that compromise circulatory system functions could have the potential to prevent or ameliorate age-related cardiovascular diseases. In support of this concept, emerging evidence suggests that targeting the circulatory system might restore organ function. In this Roadmap, we delve into the organ-specific and cell-specific mechanisms that underlie ageing-related changes in the cardiovascular system. We raise unanswered questions regarding the optimal design of clinical trials, in which markers of biological ageing in humans could be assessed. We provide guidance for the development of gerotherapeutics, which will rely on the technological progress of the diagnostic toolbox to measure residual risk in elderly individuals. A major challenge in the quest to discover interventions that delay age-related conditions in humans is to identify molecular switches that can delay the onset of ageing changes. To overcome this roadblock, future clinical trials need to provide evidence that gerotherapeutics directly affect one or several hallmarks of ageing in such a manner as to delay, prevent, alleviate or treat age-associated dysfunction and diseases.",

In line with this pleiotropic importance for cellular and organismal life and death, lysosomal dysfunction is associated with many age-related pathologies like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, as well as with a decline in lifespan. Conversely, targeting lysosomal functional capacity is emerging as a means to promote longevity. Here, we analyze the current knowledge on the prominent influence of lysosomes on aging-related processes, such as their executory and regulatory roles during general and selective macroautophagy, or their storage capacity for amino acids and ions. In addition, we review and discuss the roles of lysosomes as active players in the mechanisms underlying known lifespan-extending interventions like, for example, spermidine or rapamycin administration. In conclusion, this review aims at critically examining the nature and pliability of the different layers, in which lysosomes are involved as a control hub for aging and longevity.",

    "abstract": "Brain aging and cognitive decline are significant biomedical and societal concerns. Both dietary restriction, such as limiting protein intake, and fasting, which restricts the timing of food consumption, have been proposed as strategies to delay aspects of aging. Recent studies suggest that intermittent fasting effects are mediated by the endogenous polyamine spermidine. Spermidine supplementation promotes mitochondrial integrity and functionality in aging brains by supporting hypusination of the translational initiation factor eIF5A. However, how molecular mechanisms underlying fasting mimicking interventions and protein restriction converge remain unclear, yet biomedically relevant. In this study, we combined low- and high-protein diets (2% versus 12% yeast in food) with spermidine supplementation in aging ",

Aging is an irreversible and inevitable process that is a risk factor for pathological progression of diverse age-related diseases. Spermidine, a natural polyamine, plays a critical role in molecular and cellular interactions involved in various physiological and functional processes. Spermidine has been shown to modulate aging, suppress the occurrence and severity of age-related diseases, and prolong lifespan. However, the precise mechanisms through which spermidine exerts its anti-aging effects have not been established. In this review, we elucidate on the mechanisms and roles underlying the beneficial effects of spermidine in aging from a molecular and cellular perspective.

Metabolic regulation of cytokine signaling is critical for cellular homeostasis. Through metabolomics analyses of IFN-β-activated macrophages and an IFN-stimulated-response-element reporter screening, we identified spermine as a metabolite brake for Janus kinase (JAK) signaling. Spermine directly bound to the FERM and SH2 domains of JAK1 to impair JAK1-cytokine receptor interaction, thus broadly suppressing JAK1 phosphorylation triggered by cytokines IFN-I, IFN-II, interleukin (IL)-2, and IL-6. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from individuals with SLE showing decreased spermine concentrations exhibited enhanced IFN-I and lupus gene signatures. Spermine treatment attenuated autoimmune pathogenesis in SLE and psoriasis mice and reduced IFN-I signaling in monocytes from individuals with SLE. We synthesized a spermine derivative (spermine derivative 1 [SD1]) and showed that it had a potent immunosuppressive function. Our findings reveal spermine as a metabolic checkpoint for cellular homeostasis and a potential immunosuppressive molecule for controlling autoimmune disease.",

Here, we present Compass, an algorithm to characterize cellular metabolic states based on single-cell RNA sequencing and flux balance analysis. We applied Compass to associate metabolic states with T helper 17 (Th17) functional variability (pathogenic potential) and recovered a metabolic switch between glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation, akin to known Th17/regulatory T cell (Treg) differences, which we validated by metabolic assays. Compass also predicted that Th17 pathogenicity was associated with arginine and downstream polyamine metabolism. Indeed, polyamine-related enzyme expression was enhanced in pathogenic Th17 and suppressed in Treg cells. Chemical and genetic perturbation of polyamine metabolism inhibited Th17 cytokines, promoted Foxp3 expression, and remodeled the transcriptome and epigenome of Th17 cells toward a Treg-like state. In vivo perturbations of the polyamine pathway altered the phenotype of encephalitogenic T cells and attenuated tissue inflammation in CNS autoimmunity.",

Of the polyamine spectrum analyzed, N1-acetylspermidine (N1-Ac-Spd) accumulated in HCC tissue as compared with nontumoral liver tissue and was elevated in paired plasma. Injection of N1-Ac-Spd promoted tumor progression in preclinical models and compromised the efficacy of ICB. Inflammatory macrophages increased expression of the spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1, SAT1, in hepatoma cells, leading to increased N1-Ac-Spd efflux via the polyamine transporter protein SLC3A2.

    "abstract": "The natural mammalian polyamines putrescine, spermidine and spermine are essential for both normal and neoplastic cell function and replication. Dysregulation of metabolism of polyamines and their requirements is common in many cancers. Both clinical and experimental depletion of polyamines have demonstrated their metabolism to be a rational target for therapy; however, the mechanisms through which polyamines can establish a tumour-permissive microenvironment are only now emerging. Recent data indicate that polyamines can play a major role in regulating the antitumour immune response, thus likely contributing to the existence of immunologically 'cold' tumours that do not respond to immune checkpoint blockade. Additionally, the interplay between the microbiota and associated tissues creates a tumour microenvironment in which polyamine metabolism, content and function can all be dramatically altered on the basis of microbiota composition, dietary polyamine availability and tissue response to its surrounding microenvironment. The goal of this Perspective is to introduce the reader to the many ways in which polyamines, polyamine metabolism, the microbiota and the diet interconnect to establish a tumour microenvironment that facilitates the initiation and progression of cancer. It also details ways in which polyamine metabolism and function can be successfully targeted for therapeutic benefit, including specifically enhancing the antitumour immune response.",

    "abstract": "The human gut microbiota plays numerous roles in regulating host growth, the immune system, and metabolism. Age-related changes in the gut environment lead to chronic inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, and illness, which in turn affect aging and increase the risk of neurodegenerative disorders. Local immunity is also affected by changes in the gut environment. Polyamines are crucial for cell development, proliferation, and tissue regeneration. They regulate enzyme activity, bind to and stabilize DNA and RNA, have antioxidative properties, and are necessary for the control of translation. All living organisms contain the natural polyamine spermidine, which has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It can regulate protein expression, prolong life, and improve mitochondrial metabolic activity and respiration. Spermidine levels experience an age-related decrease, and the development of age-related diseases is correlated with decreased endogenous spermidine concentrations. As more than just a consequence, this review explores the connection between polyamine metabolism and aging and identifies advantageous bacteria for anti-aging and metabolites they produce. Further research is being conducted on probiotics and prebiotics that support the uptake and ingestion of spermidine from food extracts or stimulate the production of polyamines by gut microbiota. This provides a successful strategy to increase spermidine levels.",

    "abstract": "Growing attention has been directed toward the critical role of polyamines in the tumor microenvironment and immune regulation. Polyamines, primarily comprising putrescine, spermidine, and spermine, are tightly regulated through coordinated biosynthesis, catabolism, and transport, with distinct metabolic patterns between normal and cancerous tissues. Emerging evidence highlights the pivotal role of polyamine metabolism in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. This review aims to elucidate the differences in polyamine biosynthesis, transport, and catabolism between normal and cancerous tissues, as well as the associated alterations in tumor epigenetic modifications and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade driven by polyamine metabolism. Polyamine metabolism influences both tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment by modulating immune cell phenotypes-shifting them towards either tumor suppression or immune evasion within the tumor immune microenvironment. Additionally, polyamine metabolism impacts immunotherapy through its regulation of key enzymes. This review also explores potential therapeutic targets and summarizes the roles of polyamine inhibitors in combination with immunotherapy for cancer treatment, offering a novel perspective on therapeutic strategies.",

Polyamines are important for posttranscriptional regulation, autophagy, programmed cell death, proliferation, redox homeostasis, and ion channel function. Their levels are tightly controlled. High levels of polyamines are associated with proliferative pathologies such as cancer, whereas low polyamine levels are observed in aging, and elevated polyamine turnover enhances oxidative stress. Polyamine metabolism is implicated in several pathophysiological processes in the nervous, immune, and cardiovascular systems. Currently, manipulating polyamine levels is under investigation as a potential preventive treatment for several pathologies, including aging, ischemia/reperfusion injury, pulmonary hypertension, and cancer. Although polyamines have been implicated in many intracellular mechanisms, our understanding of these processes remains incomplete and is a topic of ongoing investigation.

    "abstract": "The intestinal epithelium is a rapidly self-renewing tissue; the rapid turnover prevents the invasion of pathogens and harmful components from the intestinal lumen, preventing inflammation and infectious diseases. Intestinal epithelial barrier function depends on the epithelial cell proliferation and junctions, as well as the state of the immune system in the lamina propria. Polyamines, particularly putrescine, spermidine, and spermine, are essential for many cell functions and play a crucial role in mammalian cellular homeostasis, such as that of cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and maintenance, through multiple biological processes, including translation, transcription, and autophagy. Although the vital role of polyamines in normal intestinal epithelial cell growth and barrier function has been known since the 1980s, recent studies have provided new insights into this topic at the molecular level, such as eukaryotic initiation factor-5A hypusination and autophagy, with rapid advances in polyamine biology in normal cells using biological technologies. This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of the role of polyamines in regulating normal, non-cancerous, intestinal epithelial barrier function, with a particular focus on intestinal epithelial renewal, cell junctions, and immune cell differentiation in the lamina propria.",

    "abstract": "L- Arginine (2-Amino-5-guanidinovaleric acid, L-Arg) is a semi-essential amino acid that is mainly produced within the urea cycle. It acts as a key precursor in the synthesis of proteins, urea, creatine, prolamines (including putrescine, spermine, and spermidine), proline, and nitric oxide (NO). WhenL-Arg is metabolized, it produces NO, glutamate, and prolamines, which all play important regulatory roles in various physiological functions. In addition to its metabolic roles,L-Arg significantly influences immune responses, especially in the context of inflammation and autoimmune diseases. It affects the activity of immune cells by modulating T-cell function, the polarization of macrophages, and the release of cytokines. Importantly,L-Arg plays a dual role in immune regulation, functioning as both an immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive agent depending on the specific cellular and biochemical environments. This review examines the immunopharmacological mechanisms of L-Arg, emphasizing its involvement in inflammatory responses and its potential therapeutic uses in autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease. By influencing the pathways of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and arginase (ARG), L-Arg helps maintain immune balance and contributes to the pathophysiology of diseases. Gaining a better understanding of the pharmacological effects of L-Arg on immune regulation could yield new perspectives on targeted treatments for immune-related diseases. Exploring its impact on immune signaling and metabolic pathways may result in novel therapeutic approaches for chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disorders.",

    "abstract": "The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) is an evolutionarily conserved protein that binds ribosomes to facilitate the translation of peptide motifs with consecutive prolines or combinations of prolines with glycine and charged amino acids. It has also been linked to other molecular functions and cellular processes, such as nuclear mRNA export and mRNA decay, proliferation, differentiation, autophagy, and apoptosis. The growing interest in eIF5A relates to its association with the pathogenesis of several diseases, including cancer, viral infection, and diabetes. It has also been proposed as an anti-aging factor: its levels decay in aged cells, whereas increasing levels of active eIF5A result in the rejuvenation of the immune and vascular systems and improved brain cognition. Recent data have linked the role of eIF5A in some pathologies with its function in maintaining healthy mitochondria. The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A is upregulated under respiratory metabolism and its deficiency reduces oxygen consumption, ATP production, and the levels of several mitochondrial metabolic enzymes, as well as altering mitochondria dynamics. However, although all the accumulated data strongly link eIF5A to mitochondrial function, the precise molecular role and mechanisms involved are still unknown. In this review, we discuss the findings linking eIF5A and mitochondria, speculate about its role in regulating mitochondrial homeostasis, and highlight its potential as a target in diseases related to energy metabolism.",
