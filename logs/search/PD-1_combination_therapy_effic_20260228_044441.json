    "abstract": "Antibodies targeting programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) or its ligand PD-L1 rescue T cells from exhausted status and revive immune response against cancer cells. Based on the immense success in clinical trials, ten α-PD-1 (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, cemiplimab, sintilimab, camrelizumab, toripalimab, tislelizumab, zimberelimab, prolgolimab, and dostarlimab) and three α-PD-L1 antibodies (atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab) have been approved for various types of cancers. Nevertheless, the low response rate of α-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy remains to be resolved. For most cancer patients, PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is not the sole speed-limiting factor of antitumor immunity, and it is insufficient to motivate effective antitumor immune response by blocking PD-1/PD-L1 axis. It has been validated that some combination therapies, including α-PD-1/PD-L1 plus chemotherapy, radiotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, targeted therapy, other immune checkpoint inhibitors, agonists of the co-stimulatory molecule, stimulator of interferon genes agonists, fecal microbiota transplantation, epigenetic modulators, or metabolic modulators, have superior antitumor efficacies and higher response rates. Moreover, bifunctional or bispecific antibodies containing α-PD-1/PD-L1 moiety also elicited more potent antitumor activity. These combination strategies simultaneously boost multiple processes in cancer-immunity cycle, remove immunosuppressive brakes, and orchestrate an immunosupportive tumor microenvironment. In this review, we summarized the synergistic antitumor efficacies and mechanisms of α-PD-1/PD-L1 in combination with other therapies. Moreover, we focused on the advances of α-PD-1/PD-L1-based immunomodulatory strategies in clinical studies. Given the heterogeneity across patients and cancer types, individualized combination selection could improve the effects of α-PD-1/PD-L1-based immunomodulatory strategies and relieve treatment resistance.",

    "abstract": "Programmed death 1 (PD-1) is an immune checkpoint molecule that negatively regulates T-cell immune function through the interaction with its ligand PD-L1. Blockage of this interaction unleashes the immune system to fight cancer. Immunotherapy using PD-1 blockade has led to a paradigm shift in the field of cancer drug discovery, owing to its durable effect against a wide variety of cancers with limited adverse effects. A brief history and development of PD-1 blockade, from the initial discovery of PD-1 to the recent clinical output of this therapy, have been summarized here. Despite its tremendous clinical success rate over other cancer treatments, PD-1 blockade has its own pitfall; a significant fraction of patients remains unresponsive to this therapy. The key to improve the PD-1 blockade therapy is the development of combination therapies. As this approach has garnered worldwide interest, here, we have summarized the recent trends in the development of PD-1 blockade-based combination therapies and the ongoing clinical trials. These include combinations with checkpoint inhibitors, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and several other existing cancer treatments. Importantly, FDA has approved PD-1 blockade agent to be used in combination with either CTLA-4 blockade or chemotherapy. Responsiveness to the PD-1 blockade therapy is affected by tumour and immune system-related factors. The role of the immune system, especially T cells, in determining the responsiveness has been poorly studied compared with those factors related to the tumour side. Energy metabolism has emerged as one of the important regulatory mechanisms for the function and differentiation of T cells. We have documented here the recent results regarding the augmentation of PD-1 blockade efficacy by augmenting mitochondrial energy metabolism of T cell.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Modulation and depletion strategies of regulatory T cells (Tregs) constitute valid approaches in antitumor immunotherapy but suffer from severe adverse effects due to their lack of selectivity for the tumor-infiltrating (ti-)Treg population, indicating the need for a ti-Treg specific biomarker. METHODS: We employed single-cell RNA-sequencing in a mouse model of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) to obtain a comprehensive overview of the tumor-infiltrating T-cell compartment, with a focus on ti-Treg subpopulations. These findings were validated by flow cytometric analysis of both mouse (LLC-OVA, MC38 and B16-OVA) and human (NSCLC and melanoma) tumor samples. We generated two CCR8-specific nanobodies (Nbs) that recognize distinct epitopes on the CCR8 extracellular domain. These Nbs were formulated as tetravalent Nb-Fc fusion proteins for optimal CCR8 binding and blocking, containing either an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)-deficient or an ADCC-prone Fc region. The therapeutic use of these Nb-Fc fusion proteins was evaluated, either as monotherapy or as combination therapy with anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (anti-PD-1), in both the LLC-OVA and MC38 mouse models. RESULTS: We were able to discern two ti-Treg populations, one of which is characterized by the unique expression of  CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings highlight the efficacy and safety of targeting CCR8 for the depletion of tumor-promoting ti-Tregs in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer has the second-highest mortality rate among malignant tumors of the female reproductive system. Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade are promising therapeutic agents, but their efficacy when combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has not been fully tested, and how they alter the tumor microenvironment has not been comprehensively elucidated. METHODS: In this study, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing using 46,950 cells from nine human cervical cancer tissues representing sequential different stages of NACT and PD-1 blockade combination therapy. We delineated the trajectory of cervical epithelial cells and identified the crucial factors involved in combination therapy. Cell-cell communication analysis was performed between tumor and immune cells. In addition, THP-1-derived and primary monocyte-derived macrophages were cocultured with cervical cancer cells and phagocytosis was detected by flow cytometry. The antitumor activity of blocking CD74 was validated in vivo using a CD74 humanized subcutaneous tumor model. RESULTS: Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that NACT activated cytokine and complement-related immune responses. Cell-cell communication analysis revealed that after NACT therapy, interaction strength between T cells and cancer cells decreased, but intensified between macrophages and cancer cells. We verified that macrophages were necessary for the PD-1 blockade to exert antitumor effects in vitro. Additionally, CD74-positive macrophages frequently interacted with the most immunoreactive epithelial subgroup 3 (Epi3) cancer subgroup during combination NACT. We found that CD74 upregulation limited phagocytosis and stimulated M2 polarization, whereas CD74 blockade enhanced macrophage phagocytosis, decreasing cervical cancer cell viability in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals the dynamic cell-cell interaction network in the cervical cancer microenvironment influenced by combining NACT and PD-1 blockade. Furthermore, blocking tumor-associated macrophage-derived CD74 could augment neoadjuvant therapeutic efficacy.",

Electroacupuncture (EA) has oncosuppressive and immunomodulatory properties. Here, we investigated the antitumor effects of EA and explored the feasibility of EA combined with anti-PD-1 in MSS colorectal cancer. Results showed that EA exerted its antitumor effect in an intensity-specific manner, and moderate-intensity EA (1.0 mA) induced maximal tumor inhibition. EA enhanced antitumor immune responses by increasing lymphocytes and granzyme B (GzmB) levels, as well as activating the stimulator of IFN genes (STING) pathway. EA combined with anti-PD-1 showed superior efficacy compared with either monotherapy in multiple MSS colorectal cancer mouse models. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that cotreatment reprogrammed the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), as characterized by enhancement of cytotoxic functions. Mechanically, we found that the potentiated effect of EA was dependent upon the STING pathway. Collectively, EA reshapes the TIME of MSS colorectal cancer and sensitizes tumors to anti-PD-1 in a STING pathway-dependent manner. These results provide a mechanistic rationale for using EA as an immunomodulatory strategy to improve the clinical efficacy of anti-PD-1 in MSS colorectal cancer. EA is safe, well-tolerated, and feasible for clinical translation as a promising strategy for treating MSS colorectal cancer.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors in colorectal cancer (CRC) is limited due to the low tumor neoantigen load and low immune infiltration in most microsatellite-stable (MSS) tumors. This study aimed to develop a mitochondria-targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT) approach to provoke host antitumor immunity of MSS-CRC and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS: The role and mechanism of mitochondria-targeted PDT in inhibiting CRC progression and inducing pyroptosis were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. The immune effects of PDT sensitization on PD-1 blockade were also assessed in CT26 and 4T1 tumor-bearing mouse models. RESULTS: Here, we report that PDT using IR700DX-6T, a photosensitizer targeting the mitochondrial translocation protein, may trigger an antitumor immune response initiated by pyroptosis in CRC. Mechanistically, IR700DX-6T-PDT produced reactive oxygen species on light irradiation and promoted downstream p38 phosphorylation and active caspase3 (CASP3)-mediated cleavage of gasdermin E (GSDME), subsequently inducing pyroptosis. Furthermore, IR700DX-6T-PDT enhanced the sensitivity of MSS-CRC cells to PD-1 blockade. Decitabine, a demethylation drug used to treat hematologic neoplasms, disrupted the abnormal methylation pattern of GSDME in tumor cells, enhanced the efficacy of IR700DX-6T-PDT, and elicited a potent antitumor immune response in combination with PD-1 blockade and IR700DX-6T-PDT. CONCLUSION: Our work provides clear a understanding of immunogenic cell death triggered by mitochondria-targeted PDT, offering a new approach for enhancing the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in CRC.",

METHODS: A computerized systematic search of databases, such as PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wanfang Data, and VIP e-Journals was performed to retrieve studies comparing TACE + apatinib combined with a PD-1 inhibitor versus a non-triple therapy for the treatment of advanced primary HCC. The literature search, quality assessment, and data extraction were performed independently by two researchers. Stata 16.0 software was employed to analyze the data. Heterogeneity was assessed utilizing the I2 statistic and p-value, followed by conducting sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: A total of 2,352 patients were enrolled from 8 studies, including 900 patients in the triple therapy group of TACE + apatinib combined with a PD-1 inhibitor, 877 patients in the TACE + apatinib group, 52 patients in the apatinib + a PD-1 inhibitor group, and 112 patients in the TACE group. The results revealed that the objective response rate (ORR) was significantly higher in the triple therapy group of TACE + apatinib combined with a PD-1 inhibitor than that in the non-triple therapy group [odds ratio (OR)=2.47, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 1.61-3.78]. Besides, disease control rate (DCR) was greater in the triple therapy group of TACE + apatinib combined with a PD-1 inhibitor than that in the non-triple therapy group (OR=1.87, 95%CI: 1.44-2.44). Patients in the triple therapy group experienced a significant extension of overall survival (OS) (HR=0.42, 95%CI: 0.36-0.49). In addition, there was no significant difference in the overall rate of adverse events (AEs) between the two groups (OR=1.05, 95%CI: 0.89-1.22). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the non-triple therapy group, the triple therapy group of TACE + apatinib combined with a PD-1 inhibitor outperformed in terms of tumor response and long-term survival with manageable AEs.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The efficacy of neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy (NAT) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is challenged by the intricate interplay within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Unveiling the immune landscape of ESCC in the context of NAT could shed light on heterogeneity and optimize therapeutic strategies for patients. METHODS: We analyzed single cells from 22 baseline and 24 post-NAT treatment samples of stage II/III ESCC patients to explore the association between the immune landscape and pathological response to neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 combination therapy, including pathological complete response (pCR), major pathological response (MPR), and incomplete pathological response (IPR). RESULTS: Single-cell profiling identified 14 major cell subsets of cancer, immune, and stromal cells. Trajectory analysis unveiled an interesting link between cancer cell differentiation and pathological response to NAT. ESCC tumors enriched with less differentiated cancer cells exhibited a potentially favorable pathological response to NAT, while tumors enriched with clusters of more differentiated cancer cells may resist treatment. Deconvolution of transcriptomes in pre-treatment tumors identified gene signatures in response to NAT contributed by specific immune cell populations. Upregulated genes associated with better pathological responses in CD8 + effector T cells primarily involved interferon-gamma (IFNγ) signaling, neutrophil degranulation, and negative regulation of the T cell apoptotic process, whereas downregulated genes were dominated by those in the immune response-activating cell surface receptor signaling pathway. Natural killer cells in pre-treatment tumors from pCR patients showed a similar upregulation of gene expression in response to IFNγ but a downregulation of genes in the neutrophil-mediated immunity pathways. A decreased cellular contexture of regulatory T cells in ESCC TME indicated a potentially favorable pathological response to NAT. Cell-cell communication analysis revealed extensive interactions between CCL5 and its receptor CCR5 in various immune cells of baseline pCR tumors. Immune checkpoint interaction pairs, including CTLA4-CD86, TIGIT-PVR, LGALS9-HAVCR2, and TNFSF4-TNFRSF4, might serve as additional therapeutic targets for ICI therapy in ESCC. CONCLUSIONS: This pioneering study unveiled an intriguing association between cancer cell differentiation and pathological response in esophageal cancer patients, revealing distinct subgroups of tumors for which neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy might be effective. We also delineated the immune landscape of ESCC tumors in the context of clinical response to NAT, which provides clinical insights for better understanding how patients respond to the treatment and further identifying novel therapeutic targets for ESCC patients in the future.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have emerged as a revolutionary cancer treatment modality, offering long-lasting responses and survival benefits for a substantial number of cancer patients. However, the response rates to ICIs vary significantly among individuals and cancer types, with a notable proportion of patients exhibiting resistance or showing no response. Therefore, dual ICI combination therapy has been proposed as a potential strategy to address these challenges. One of the targets is TIGIT, an inhibitory receptor associated with T-cell exhaustion. TIGIT has diverse immunosuppressive effects on the cancer immunity cycle, including the inhibition of natural killer cell effector function, suppression of dendritic cell maturation, promotion of macrophage polarization to the M2 phenotype, and differentiation of T cells to regulatory T cells. Furthermore, TIGIT is linked with PD-1 expression, and it can synergize with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade to enhance tumor rejection. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the potential benefits of co-inhibition of TIGIT and PD-1/PD-L1 in enhancing anti-tumor immunity and improving treatment outcomes in several cancer types. Several clinical trials are underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TIGIT and PD-1/PD-L1 co-inhibition in various cancer types, and the results are awaited. This review provides an overview of the mechanisms of TIGIT and PD-1/PD-L1 co-inhibition in anti-tumor treatment, summarizes the latest clinical trials investigating this combination therapy, and discusses its prospects. Overall, co-inhibition of TIGIT and PD-1/PD-L1 represents a promising therapeutic approach for cancer treatment that has the potential to improve the outcomes of cancer patients treated with ICIs.",

However, broad application of this combination has been limited by toxicities. Cadonilimab (AK104) is a symmetric tetravalent bispecific antibody with a crystallizable fragment (Fc)-null design. In addition to demonstrating biological activity similar to that of the combination of CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies, cadonilimab possess higher binding avidity in a high-density PD-1 and CTLA-4 setting than in a low-density PD-1 setting, while a mono-specific anti-PD-1 antibody does not demonstrate this differential activity. With no binding to Fc receptors, cadonilimab shows minimal antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, and interleukin-6 (IL-6)/IL-8 release. These features all likely contribute to significantly lower toxicities of cadonilimab observed in the clinic. Higher binding avidity of cadonilimab in a tumor-like setting and Fc-null design may lead to better drug retention in tumors and contribute to better safety while achieving anti-tumor efficacy.",

    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Preferred neoadjuvant strategies for early or locally advanced triple-negative breast cancer include a 4-drug chemotherapy regimen containing anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide, taxanes, and platinum. Blockade of the programmed death receptor 1/ligand-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) pathway may improve efficacy of classic neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Camrelizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, has showed antitumor activity in advanced triple-negative breast cancer. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and adverse events of camrelizumab plus chemotherapy vs placebo plus chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy for patients with early or locally advanced triple-negative breast cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial enrolled patients from 40 hospitals in China between November 25, 2020, and May 12, 2023 (data cutoff: September 30, 2023). A total of 441 eligible patients were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either camrelizumab 200 mg (n = 222) or placebo (n = 219) combined with chemotherapy every 2 weeks. The chemotherapy included nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/m2) and carboplatin (area under the curve, 1.5) on days 1, 8, and 15 in 28-day cycles for the first 16 weeks followed by epirubicin (90 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) every 2 weeks for 8 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was pathological complete response (defined as no invasive tumor in breast and lymph nodes [ypT0/Tis ypN0]). RESULTS: Among 441 females randomized (median age, 48 years), the median (range) follow-up duration from randomization was 14.4 (0.0-31.8) months. Pathological complete response was achieved in 126 patients (56.8% [95% CI, 50.0%-63.4%]) in the camrelizumab-chemotherapy group and 98 patients (44.7% [95% CI, 38.0%-51.6%]) in the placebo-chemotherapy group (rate difference, 12.2% [95% CI, 3.3%-21.2%]; 1-sided P = .004). In the neoadjuvant phase, adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 198 patients (89.2%) in the camrelizumab-chemotherapy group and 182 (83.1%) in the placebo-chemotherapy group; serious adverse events occurred in 77 patients (34.7%) in the camrelizumab-chemotherapy group and 50 (22.8%) in the placebo-chemotherapy group, with fatal adverse events occurring in 2 patients (0.9%) in the camrelizumab-chemotherapy group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with early or locally advanced triple-negative breast cancer, the addition of camrelizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved pathological complete response.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant programmed cell death 1 protein (PD-1) or programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade combined with chemotherapy in enhancing surgical outcomes and pathological responses in patients with T4 and/or N2-N3 stage III NSCLC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter cohort study analyzed data from patients treated between February 2018 and January 2024 with neoadjuvant PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors plus chemotherapy at academic and tertiary care centers across the US and Italy. Pathological and survival outcomes were assessed. Patients with stage III NSCLC and T4 and/or N2-N3 involvement were included. Data were collected from February 2018 to January 2024. EXPOSURES: Neoadjuvant PD-1/PD-L1 blockade combined with platinum-based chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Pathological complete response (pCR), major pathological response, surgical resectability, and event-free survival (EFS). RESULTS: Of 112 patients, 58 (51.8%) were female, and the median (range) age was 66 (41-84) years. A total of 84(75.0%) underwent surgical resection, achieving a pCR rate of 29.0% (24 of 83 with available final pathology) and a major pathological response rate of 42.2% (35 of 83). Patients with both PD-L1 expression of 50% or more and high tumor mutational burden achieved the highest pCR rate (4 of 9 [44.4%]; P = .03). Conversely, covariants in KRAS/STK11 or KRAS/KEAP1 were associated with lack of pCR. Patients with single-station or multistation N2/N3 disease exhibited comparable pathological outcomes. The median EFS for all resected patients was 52.6 months (95% CI, 27.8 to not reached), and this was significantly longer in patients with pCR (not reached vs 27.8 months [95% CI, 19.5 to not reached]; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, neoadjuvant PD-1/PD-L1 blockade combined with chemotherapy resulted in high pathological response rates and surgical resectability in patients with T4 and/or N2-N3 stage III NSCLC. This approach offers a viable treatment option for patients with borderline resectable or unresectable NSCLC but requires further validation through prospective studies.",

    "abstract": "The clinical benefit of neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy in locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) remains unclear. This single-arm, phase II study (Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR2200065392) aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody tislelizumab in combination with chemotherapy in treatment-naïve patients with stage IB3/IIA2 LACC. Enrolled patients received tislelizumab (200 mg, every 3 weeks) plus chemotherapy for 3 cycles before radical surgery. The primary endpoint was the pathological complete response (pCR). Secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1, disease-free survival, overall survival, and safety. Exploratory endpoints included tissue-based and blood-based biomarkers to identify the biological drivers behind the clinical outcomes. Between November 2022 and March 2024, 30 patients were enrolled. All patients completed 3 cycles of neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy and underwent radical surgery. The pCR was observed in 20 (66.7%) patients, and 4 (13.3%) patients achieved major pathological response (MPR), with an optimal pathological response rate (OPR) of 80.0%. The ORR was 90.0%, with 17 (56.7%) complete responses. Survival data were immature at the median follow-up of 14.7 months (data cutoff, December 31, 2024). Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) and immune-related AEs occurred in 26.7% and 3.3% of patients, respectively. No treatment-related death occurred. Patients with pCR had significantly higher expression of PD-L1 CPS at baseline, and a strong relationship with immune-related signature (all p < 0.05). Neoadjuvant tislelizumab plus chemotherapy showed promising antitumor efficacy and a well-tolerated safety profile in patients with stage IB3/IIA2 LACC, and might be a potential option in this population.",

    "abstract": "Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICBs), in addition to targeting CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1, novel targeting LAG-3 drugs have also been approved in clinical application. With the widespread use of the drug, we must deeply analyze the dilemma of the agents and seek a breakthrough in the treatment prospect. Over the past decades, these agents have demonstrated dramatic efficacy, especially in patients with melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nonetheless, in the field of a broad concept of solid tumours, non-specific indications, inseparable immune response and side effects, unconfirmed progressive disease, and complex regulatory networks of immune resistance are four barriers that limit its widespread application. Fortunately, the successful clinical trials of novel ICB agents and combination therapies, the advent of the era of oncolytic virus gene editing, and the breakthrough of the technical barriers of mRNA vaccines and nano-delivery systems have made remarkable breakthroughs currently. In this review, we enumerate the mechanisms of each immune checkpoint targets, associations between ICB with tumour mutation burden, key immune regulatory or resistance signalling pathways, the specific clinical evidence of the efficacy of classical targets and new targets among different tumour types and put forward dialectical thoughts on drug safety. Finally, we discuss the importance of accurate triage of ICB based on recent advances in predictive biomarkers and diagnostic testing techniques.",

    "abstract": "Significant technological advances in radiotherapy have been made in the past few decades. High-precision radiotherapy has recently become popular and is contributing to improvements in the local control of the irradiated target lesions and the reduction of adverse effects. Accordingly, for long-term survival, the importance of systemic cancer control, including at non-irradiated sites, is growing. Toward this challenge, the treatment methods in which anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies that exert systemic effects by restoring anti-tumour immunity are combined with radiotherapy has attracted attention in recent years. Previous studies have reported the activation of anti-tumour immunity by radiotherapy, which simultaneously elevates PD-L1 expression, suggesting a potential for combination therapy. Radiotherapy induces so-called 'immunogenic cell death', which involves cell surface translocation of calreticulin and extracellular release of high-mobility group protein box 1 (HMGB-1) and adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP). Furthermore, radiotherapy causes immune activation via MHC class I upregulation and cGAS-STING pathway. In contrast, induction of immunosuppressive lymphocytes and the release of immunosuppressive cytokines and chemokines by radiotherapy contribute to immunosuppressive reactions. In this article, we review immune responses induced by radiotherapy as well as previous reports to support the rationale of combination of radiotherapy and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies. A number of preclinical and clinical studies have shown the efficacy of radiotherapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibition, hence combination therapy is considered to be an important future strategy for cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: PD-1 blockade is highly effective in patients with mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high metastatic colorectal cancer. The role of single-agent PD-1 blockade in the neoadjuvant setting for resectable mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high colorectal cancer remains unclear. We investigated the efficacy and safety of PD-1 blockade with toripalimab, with or without the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, as neoadjuvant treatment for mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high, locally advanced, colorectal cancers. METHODS: The PD-1 Inhibitor in Microsatellite Instability Colorectal Cancer (PICC) trial was a single-centre, open-label, parallel-group, non-comparative, randomised, phase 2 study undertaken at the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China). Eligible patients were aged 18-75 years, had histologically confirmed mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high colorectal cancer, had clinical stage T3-T4 or any T with lymph node positivity (N+), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 0 or 1, and adequate haematological, hepatic, and renal function. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), without any stratification or balanced blocking, to receive toripalimab 3 mg/kg intravenously on day 1, with or without celecoxib 200 mg orally twice daily from day 1 to 14 of each 14-day cycle, for six cycles before surgical resection. Adjuvant treatment with toripalimab with or without celecoxib was permitted at the investigators' discretion. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with pathological complete response, defined as tumours without any viable tumour cells in the resected primary tumour sample and all sampled regional lymph nodes. All efficacy and safety analyses were assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population, which included all patients who were randomly assigned to treatment and who received at least one dose of toripalimab. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03926338, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between May 1, 2019, and April 1, 2021, 53 patients were screened, of whom 34 were randomly assigned to either the toripalimab plus celecoxib group (n=17) or the toripalimab monotherapy group (n=17). As of data cutoff (Aug 10, 2021), median follow-up was 14·9 months (IQR 8·8-17·0). All patients received study treatment and underwent surgical resection; there were no treatment-related surgical delays. All 34 patients had an R0 resection (>1 mm resection margin). 15 of 17 patients (88% [95% CI 64-99]) in the toripalimab plus celecoxib group and 11 of 17 patients (65% [38-86]) in the toripalimab monotherapy group had a pathological complete response. All patients continued to receive adjuvant toripalimab with or without celecoxib for a total perioperative duration of 6 months and were alive and free of recurrence at data cutoff. During neoadjuvant treatment, ten (59%) patients in the toripalimab plus celecoxib group and ten (59%) in the toripalimab monotherapy group had grade 1-2 treatment-related adverse events. Only one (3%) of 34 patients, who was in the toripalimab plus celecoxib group, had a grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse event during the neoadjuvant phase, which was grade 3 increased aspartate aminotransferase levels. In the adjuvant phase, only one (3%) of 34 patients, who was in the toripalimab monotherapy group, had a grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events, which was grade 3 increased aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels. INTERPRETATION: Neoadjuvant toripalimab with or without celecoxib could be a potential therapeutic option for patients with mismatch repair deficient or microsatellite instability-high, locally advanced, colorectal cancer. This treatment was associated with a high pathological complete response rate and an acceptable safety profile, which did not compromise surgery. Longer term follow-up is needed to assess effects on survival-related endpoints.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We previously demonstrated potent antitumor activity against human breast cancer xenografts using photodynamic therapy (PDT) targeting a novel tumor-specific photosensitizer (HS201), which binds heat shock protein 90 (HS201-PDT). However, induction of systemic antitumor immunity by HS201-PDT alone or by the combination strategy with immune checkpoint blockade has yet to be determined. METHODS: Using unilateral and bilateral implantation models of syngeneic breast tumors (E0771, MM3MG-HER2, and JC-HER3) in mice, we assessed whether HS201-PDT could induce local and systemic antitumor immunity. In an attempt to achieve a stronger abscopal effect for distant tumors, the combination strategy with anti-PD-L1 antibody was tested. Tumor-infiltrating leukocytes were analyzed by single cell RNA-sequencing and receptor-ligand interactome analysis to characterize in more detailed the mechanisms of action of the treatment and key signaling pathways involved. RESULTS: HS201-PDT demonstrated greater tumor control and survival in immune competent mice than in immunocompromised mice, suggesting the role of induced antitumor immunity; however, survival was modest and an abscopal effect on distant implanted tumor was weak. A combination of HS201-PDT with anti-PD-L1 antibody demonstrated the greatest antigen-specific immune response, tumor growth suppression, prolonged mouse survival time and abscopal effect. The most significant increase of intratumoral, activated CD8+T cells and decrease of exhausted CD8+T cells occurred following combination treatment compared with HS201-PDT monotherapy. Receptor-ligand interactome analysis showed marked enhancement of several pathways, such as CXCL, GALECTIN, GITRL, PECAM1 and NOTCH, associated with CD8+T cell activation in the combination group. Notably, the expression of the CXCR3 gene signature was the highest in the combination group, possibly explaining the enhanced tumor infiltration by T cells. CONCLUSIONS: The increased antitumor activity and upregulated CXCR3 gene signature induced by the combination of anti-PD-L1 antibody with HS201-PDT warrants the clinical testing of HS201-PDT combined with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in patients with breast cancer, and the use of the CXCR3 gene signature as a biomarker.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) patients with progression on first-line treatment still have poor outcomes on chemotherapy. The KEYNOTE-061 study demonstrated that pembrolizumab, a PD-1inhibitor, was not better than paclitaxel as second-line therapy for MGC. Herein, we explored the efficacy and safety of PD-1inhibitor based treatment for MGC patients in the second line. METHODS: In this observational, retrospective study, we enrolled MGC patients treated with anti-PD-1 based therapy as second-line in our hospital. We primarily assessed the treatment's efficacy and safety. We also evaluated the relationship between clinical features and outcomes using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: We enrolled 129 patients with an objective response rate (ORR) of 16.3% and a disease control rate (DCR) of 79.1%. Patients treated with PD-1inhibitor combined with chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic agents had ORR of 19.6% and higher DCR of 94.1%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.10 months, and the median overall survival (OS) was 7.60 months. In univariate analysis, patients treated with PD-1inhibitor combined with chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic agents and with prior anti-PD-1 history were significantly associated with favorable PFS and OS. In the multivariate analysis, different combination therapy and prior anti-PD-1 history were independent prognosis biomarkers for PFS and OS. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 28 (21.7%) patients. Common adverse events (AEs) included fatigue, hyper/hypothyroidism, neutrophil decrease, anemia, skin reactions, proteinuria, and hypertension. We did not observe treatment-related deaths. CONCLUSION: Our current results indicated that PD-1-inhibitor and chemo-anti-angiogenic agents combination therapy and prior PD-1 treatment history might improve clinical activity for GC immunotherapy as second-line treatment with acceptable safety profiles. Further studies are needed to verify those outcomes for MGC in other centers.",
