    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: The effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is limited by treatment resistance. However, the mechanisms underlying immunotherapy resistance remain elusive. We aimed to identify the role of CT10 regulator of kinase-like (CRKL) in resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy in HCC. METHODS: Gene expression in HCC specimens from 10 patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy was identified by RNA-sequencing. A total of 404 HCC samples from tissue microarrays were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Transgenic mice (Alb-Cre/Trp53 RESULTS: CRKL was identified as a candidate anti-PD-1-resistance gene using a pooled genetic screen. CRKL overexpression nullifies anti-PD-1 treatment efficacy by mobilizing tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), which block the infiltration and function of CD8 CONCLUSIONS: Activation of the CRKL/β-catenin/VEGFα and CXCL1 axis is a critical obstacle to successful anti-PD-1 therapy. Therefore, CRKL inhibitors combined with anti-PD-1 could be useful for the treatment of HCC. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Here, we found that CRKL was overexpressed in anti-PD-1-resistant hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and that CRKL upregulation promotes anti-PD-1 resistance in HCC. We identified that upregulation of the CRKL/β-catenin/VEGFα and CXCL1 axis contributes to anti-PD-1 tolerance by promoting infiltration of tumor-associated neutrophils. These findings support the strategy of bevacizumab-based immune checkpoint inhibitor combination therapy, and CRKL inhibitors combined with anti-PD-1 therapy may be developed for the treatment of HCC.",

We report the evaluation of >300 patient samples across 22 tumor types from four KEYNOTE clinical trials. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) and a T cell-inflamed gene expression profile (GEP) exhibited joint predictive utility in identifying responders and nonresponders to the PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab. TMB and GEP were independently predictive of response and demonstrated low correlation, suggesting that they capture distinct features of neoantigenicity and T cell activation. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas database showed TMB and GEP to have a low correlation, and analysis by joint stratification revealed biomarker-defined patterns of targetable-resistance biology. These biomarkers may have utility in clinical trial design by guiding rational selection of anti-PD-1 monotherapy and combination immunotherapy regimens.",

However, the emergence of resistance as well as inadequate biomarkers for patient stratification have largely limited the clinical benefits. Here, we showed that tumors with high TYRO3 expression exhibited anti-programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death ligand 1 (anti-PD-1/PD-L1) resistance in a syngeneic mouse model and in patients who received anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Mechanistically, TYRO3 inhibited tumor cell ferroptosis triggered by anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and facilitated the development of a protumor microenvironment by reducing the M1/M2 macrophage ratio, resulting in resistance to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Inhibition of TYRO3 promoted tumor ferroptosis and sensitized resistant tumors to anti-PD-1 therapy. Collectively, our findings suggest that TYRO3 could serve as a predictive biomarker for patient selection and a promising therapeutic target to overcome anti-PD-1/PD-L1 resistance.",

Here, we report that IFN-γ promotes nuclear translocation and phase separation of YAP after anti-PD-1 therapy in tumor cells. Hydrophobic interactions of the YAP coiled-coil domain mediate droplet initiation, and weak interactions of the intrinsically disordered region in the C terminus promote droplet formation. YAP partitions with the transcription factor TEAD4, the histone acetyltransferase EP300, and Mediator1 and forms transcriptional hubs for maximizing target gene transcriptions, independent of the canonical STAT1-IRF1 transcription program. Disruption of YAP phase separation reduced tumor growth, enhanced immune response, and sensitized tumor cells to anti-PD-1 therapy. YAP activity is negatively correlated with patient outcome. Our study indicates that YAP mediates the IFN-γ pro-tumor effect through its nuclear phase separation and suggests that YAP can be used as a predictive biomarker and target of anti-PD-1 combination therapy.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies targeting programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) or its ligand PD-L1 rescue T cells from exhausted status and revive immune response against cancer cells. Based on the immense success in clinical trials, ten α-PD-1 (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, cemiplimab, sintilimab, camrelizumab, toripalimab, tislelizumab, zimberelimab, prolgolimab, and dostarlimab) and three α-PD-L1 antibodies (atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab) have been approved for various types of cancers. Nevertheless, the low response rate of α-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy remains to be resolved. For most cancer patients, PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is not the sole speed-limiting factor of antitumor immunity, and it is insufficient to motivate effective antitumor immune response by blocking PD-1/PD-L1 axis. It has been validated that some combination therapies, including α-PD-1/PD-L1 plus chemotherapy, radiotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, targeted therapy, other immune checkpoint inhibitors, agonists of the co-stimulatory molecule, stimulator of interferon genes agonists, fecal microbiota transplantation, epigenetic modulators, or metabolic modulators, have superior antitumor efficacies and higher response rates. Moreover, bifunctional or bispecific antibodies containing α-PD-1/PD-L1 moiety also elicited more potent antitumor activity. These combination strategies simultaneously boost multiple processes in cancer-immunity cycle, remove immunosuppressive brakes, and orchestrate an immunosupportive tumor microenvironment. In this review, we summarized the synergistic antitumor efficacies and mechanisms of α-PD-1/PD-L1 in combination with other therapies. Moreover, we focused on the advances of α-PD-1/PD-L1-based immunomodulatory strategies in clinical studies. Given the heterogeneity across patients and cancer types, individualized combination selection could improve the effects of α-PD-1/PD-L1-based immunomodulatory strategies and relieve treatment resistance.",

T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain containing-3 (Tim-3), a promising immune checkpoint target, is cleaved by ADAM10/17 to produce its soluble form (sTim-3) in humans, potentially becoming involved in anti-PD-1 resistance. Herein, serum sTim-3 upregulation was observed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and various digestive tumors. Notably, serum sTim-3 is further upregulated in non-responding patients undergoing anti-PD-1 therapy for NSCLC and anti-PD-1-resistant cholangiocarcinoma patients. Furthermore, sTim-3 overexpression facilitates tumor progression and confers anti-PD-1 resistance in multiple tumor mouse models. Mechanistically, sTim-3 induces terminal T cell exhaustion and attenuates CD8",

FMT induced sustained microbiota changes and clinical benefits in 6 of 13 patients, with 1 partial response and 5 stable diseases, achieving an objective response rate of 7.7% and a disease control rate of 46.2%. The clinical response correlates with increased cytotoxic T cells and immune cytokines in blood and tumors. We isolated Prevotella merdae Immunoactis from a responder to FMT, which stimulates T cell activity and suppresses tumor growth in mice by enhancing cytotoxic T cell infiltration. Additionally, we found Lactobacillus salivarius and Bacteroides plebeius may inhibit anti-tumor immunity. Our findings suggest that FMT with beneficial microbiota can overcome resistance to anti-PD-1 inhibitors in advanced solid cancers, especially gastrointestinal cancers.",

    "abstract": "The release of negative regulators of immune activation (immune checkpoints) that limit antitumor responses has resulted in unprecedented rates of long-lasting tumor responses in patients with a variety of cancers. This can be achieved by antibodies blocking the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) or the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) pathway, either alone or in combination. The main premise for inducing an immune response is the preexistence of antitumor T cells that were limited by specific immune checkpoints. Most patients who have tumor responses maintain long-lasting disease control, yet one-third of patients relapse. Mechanisms of acquired resistance are currently poorly understood, but evidence points to alterations that converge on the antigen presentation and interferon-γ signaling pathways. New-generation combinatorial therapies may overcome resistance mechanisms to immune checkpoint therapy.",

    "abstract": "The tumour microenvironment (TME) drives bladder cancer (BLCA) progression. Targeting the TME has emerged as a promising strategy for BLCA treatment in recent years. Furthermore, checkpoint blockade therapies are only beneficial for a minority of patients with BLCA, and drug resistance is a barrier to achieving significant clinical effects of anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1)/programmed death protein ligand-1 (PD-L1) therapy. In this study, higher low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) levels were related to a poorer prognosis for patients with various cancers, including those with higher grades and later stages of BLCA. Enrichment analysis demonstrated that LRP1 plays a role in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), NOTCH signalling pathway, and ubiquitination. LRP1 knockdown in BLCA cells delayed BLCA progression both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, LRP1 knockdown suppressed EMT, reduced DLL4-NOTCH2 signalling activity, and downregulated M2-like macrophage polarisation. Patients with BLCA and higher LRP1 levels responded weakly to anti-PD-1 therapy in the IMvigor210 cohort. Moreover, LRP1 knockdown enhanced the therapeutic effects of anti-PD-1 in mice. Taken together, our findings suggest that LRP1 is a potential target for improving the efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy by preventing EMT and M2-like macrophage polarisation by blocking the DLL4-NOTCH2 axis.",

Consequently, it is necessary to identify predictive factors of lung cancer patients who are not only resistant to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors but also sensitive to bifunctional drugs. The purpose of this study was to search for such predictors. METHODS: Multivariable Cox regression was used to study the association between the clinical outcome of treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and lymphocyte recovery after lymphopenia in lung cancer patients. Murine CMT167 lung cancer cells were engineered to express the firefly luciferase gene and implanted orthotopically in the lung of syngeneic mice. Bioluminescence imaging, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry were employed to determine response to immunotherapy and function of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. RESULTS: For lung cancer patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies, poor lymphocyte recovery was associated with a shorter progression-free survival (PFS; P < 0.001), an accumulation of regulatory T cells (Tregs), and an elimination of CD8 CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer patients with poor lymphocyte recovery and suffering from persistent lymphopenia after previous chemotherapy are resistant to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies but might be sensitive to second-generation agents such as SHR-1701.",

    "abstract": "PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade provides significant clinical benefits for melanoma patients. We analyzed the somatic mutanomes and transcriptomes of pretreatment melanoma biopsies to identify factors that may influence innate sensitivity or resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. We find that overall high mutational loads associate with improved survival, and tumors from responding patients are enriched for mutations in the DNA repair gene BRCA2. Innately resistant tumors display a transcriptional signature (referred to as the IPRES, or innate anti-PD-1 resistance), indicating concurrent up-expression of genes involved in the regulation of mesenchymal transition, cell adhesion, extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis, and wound healing. Notably, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-targeted therapy (MAPK inhibitor) induces similar signatures in melanoma, suggesting that a non-genomic form of MAPK inhibitor resistance mediates cross-resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. Validation of the IPRES in other independent tumor cohorts defines a transcriptomic subset across distinct types of advanced cancer. These findings suggest that attenuating the biological processes that underlie IPRES may improve anti-PD-1 response in melanoma and other cancer types.",

    "abstract": "Cancer immunotherapies, represented by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), have reshaped the treatment paradigm for both advanced non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer. Programmed death receptor-1/programmed death receptor ligand-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) are some of the most common and promising targets in ICIs. Compared to ICI monotherapy, which occasionally demonstrates treatment resistance and limited efficacy, the dual blockade immunotherapy targeting PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 operates at different stages of T cell activation with synergistically enhancing immune responses against cancer cells. This emerging dual therapy heralds a new direction for cancer immunotherapy, which, however, may increase the risk of drug-related adverse reactions while improving efficacy. Previous clinical trials have explored combination therapy strategy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 agents in lung cancer, yet its efficacy remains to be unclear with the inevitable incidence of immune-related adverse events. The recent advent of bispecific antibodies has made this sort of dual targeting more feasible, aiming to alleviate toxicity without compromising efficacy. Thus, this review highlights the role of dual blockade immunotherapy targeting PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 in treating lung cancer, and further elucidates its pre-clinical mechanisms and current advancements in clinical trials. Besides, we also provide novel insights into the potential combinations of dual blockade therapies with other strategies to optimize the future treatment mode for lung cancer.",
