  abstract = {Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is a cell surface receptor that functions as a T cell checkpoint and plays a central role in regulating T cell exhaustion. Binding of PD-1 to its ligand, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), activates downstream signaling pathways and inhibits T cell activation. Moreover abnormally high PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and antigen-presenting cells in the tumor microenvironment mediates tumor immune escape, and the development of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies has recently beco...},

Programmed death receptor-1/programmed death receptor ligand-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) are some of the most common and promising targets in ICIs. Compared to ICI monotherapy, which occasionally demonstrates treatment resistance and limited efficacy, the dual blockade ...},

Blockade of programmed death 1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) with monoclonal antibodies have been known as successful examples of cancer immunotherapy in recent years. Although ICBT has been shown to be beneficial in cancers, such benefits have only been seen in a portion of cancer patients. In this regard, enhancing the therapeutic effects of inhibitin...},

However, only a subset of patients achieves durable responses, suggesting that the mechanisms of the immune checkpoint pathways are not completely understood. Here, we report that PD-L1 translocates from the plasma membrane into the nucleus through interactions with components of the en...},
